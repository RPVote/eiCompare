## Package changes

* fix vignette install error

# eiCompare 3.0.2 

## Package changes

* Removed geocoding helpers from package. These are mostly trivial to code separately and added extra dependencies to the package. Change instigated by update to previous dependency `censusxy`.

# eiCompare 3.0.1

## Minor package changes

* Switched maintainer from Loren Collingwood to Ari Decter-Frain (@aridf)
* Minor changes to functions dependent on `wru` to ensure compatibility with new version
